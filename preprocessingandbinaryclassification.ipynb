    "In summary, this binary model, which classifies music as being closer to NAV or Drake's music, is able to do so with around ~93-94% accuracy when compared across 1000 samples. Now we will work with the entire subset of artists. Several key things I learned through this process of building a binary classifier:\n",

    "1. Tradeoff between model complexity and generality for ensuring similar accuracy between training and testing sets.\n",
    "2. Importance of standardizing the data after test-train-split. Allows model to reach \"global\" minimum and far quicker.\n",
    "3. Increasing the batch-size allows the model to start off with higher accuracy and train faster overall (less epochs). I also got a higher accuracy across my test and training sets.\n",
